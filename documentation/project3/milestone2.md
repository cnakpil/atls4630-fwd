## Proposal

We are making a team productivity tool, inspired by Google Keep, Trello, and other collaborative productivity spaces. It is effectively a collaborative Todo list with the ability to keep track of who made, is assigned to, and completed which items on the list.

Technologies:

- Firebase Realtime Database
- Firebase user authentication
- TypeScript
- npm
- React.js

## MVP Functions

- [x] Basic todo list sends data to Firebase and updates changes
- [ ] Add user authentication using Firebase authentication
- [ ] Users can access specific lists
- [ ] Display who made each Todo item
- [ ] Display who completed each Todo item
- [ ] Set and display due date/deadline

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Make the page keyboard tabbable for accesibility
- [ ] Add animations for funsies
- [ ] Add multiple views, including one that sorts the items into each user's individual list
- [ ] View + use multiple lists at once

- Firebase user authentication
- TypeScript
- npm
- Parcel
- React.js

## MVP Functions

- [ ] Add user authentication using Firebase authentication
- [ ] Display who made each Todo item
- [ ] Display who completed each Todo item
- [ ] Set and display due date/deadline

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Make the page keyboard tabbable for accesibility
- [ ] Add animations for funsies
- [ ] Add multiple views, including one that sorts the items into each user's individual list
- [ ] View + use multiple lists at once

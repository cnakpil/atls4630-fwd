# Class Portal, Milestone 2

## [Link to Part 1](../week1/week1.md)

### Assignment Goal

Design and develop a class portal that will consolidate all class assignments, projects, and documentation in one place. The portal should be a good representation of my current  design and web development skills in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

### Milestone 2

- [x] Multiple HTML pages linked together in a logical manner
- [x] Pages styled with CSS, linked externally
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Clear organization between assignments and projects
- [x] Links to the process journal for each assignment/project

### Stretch Goals

- [x] Animations on link hover
- [ ] Implement light/dark mode
- [ ] Improve responsiveness with JS (swap to centered justification, swapping img headers to suit smaller screen sizes)
- [ ] Add media queries to remove hover effects on mobile devices
- [ ] Add "Back to Top" link on Assignment/Project pages

## Low Fidelity Wireframes

Contrary to proper logical order, I returned back to making some lower fidelity wireframes to help me plan the html code structure for my various layouts and pages. Planning out the code by hand before I begin allows me to do the code equivalent of "measure twice, cut once".

## Coding

### Landing Page

Since flexboxes aren't something that I'd call my strength yet, I wanted to challenge myself to build the entire layout of my site using only flexboxes. Prior to this, I'd always used CSS grids which, while easier for me to conceptulize, required a significant amount of work to make responsive.

Additionally, I wanted to try using fewer specific element ID's to style my CSS and more classes and inheritance.

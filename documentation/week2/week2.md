# Class Portal, Milestone 2

## Assignment Goal

Design and develop a class portal that will consolidate all class assignments, projects, and documentation in one place. The portal should be a good representation of my current  design and web development skills in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

### Milestone 2

- [x] Multiple HTML pages linked together in a logical manner
- [x] Pages styled with CSS, linked externally
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Clear organization between assignments and projects
- [ ] Links to the process journal for each assignment/project

### Stretch Goals

- [x] Animations on link hover
- [ ] Light/Dark mode
- [ ] Improve responsiveness with JS (swap to centered justification, swapping img headers to suit smaller screen sizes)
- [ ] Add media queries to remove hover effects on mobile devices

## Low Fidelity Wireframes

Contrary to proper logical order, I returned back to making some lower fidelity wireframes to help me plan the html code structure for my various layouts and pages. Planning out the code by hand before I begin allows me to do the code equivalent of "measure twice, cut once".

# Project 1, Milestone 2 - WIP Check-in

[PREVIOUS MILESTONE](milestone1.md)

## Proposal

Create a to-do list with persistent to-do items. Mostly inspired by other online to-do apps like Google Keep. Intended audience is anyone who uses an online app to keep track of things they need to do. All function will be run through JS/TypeScript.

### MVP Functions

- Persistent to-do list that saves data to Firebase
- Responsive design
- Complete visuals according to proposed wireframes

### Milestone 2 Goals

- [x] Finalize design
- [x] Plan out HTML
- [x] Finish basic styling
- [ ] Begin research on TS
- [ ] Begin research on Firebase

## Final Design

I realized as I got started, I had forgotten to plan out what the page would look like with no to-do items - the initial appearance of the to-do app. Therefore, I whipped one up to match the irreverent style of the whole project.

### Light

### Dark

While the full light/dark swap feature is still a stretch feature, it's always good for me to know what I'm aiming for.

## HTML Planning Wireframes

As always, I start coding by drawing out the general box model for my page. Taking into account the malleable nature of the to-do section of the page, I have tried to keep the layout as simple as possible.
